### Setting up

    Once you cloned this repo on a folder, please refer to `https://github.com/tolentinoel/flip-frontend`, clone that repo into that main folder as well together with this backend repo.

    Once done, cd into flip-backend and link the database by running `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` upon opening the file. Don't forget to run `bundle` or `bundle update` to make sure you have all the dependencies and gems needed(specifically 'rack-cors').

### Starting up the game

    On another terminal cd into flip-frontend & run `open index.html` this way you can have the app running in the browser and be able to play the game!

    Once the backend server is up and the browser is running, type in your desired player name. Please remember your player name to not lose your game history. Your submitted player name is the way for the database to remember & display your game history when you log back in.
